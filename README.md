# Binary_Search_Tree

We implement a binary search tree and a simple test driver. All inserts into the binary tree must be unique. 
Implemented methods include insert, find, inorder traverse, and iterator. 

This is the Python partial solution to this UCSD CSE 100 [assignment](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cao100/programming-assignments/pa1-bst-and-kd-tree-in-c/part-1-binary-search-tree-in-c). I coded this in C++ too, but the C++ repo is private for academic integrity reasons.

## Usage

python3 test_BST.py

Feel free to change the list of numbers L = [3,4,1,100,-33] to another list. Just make sure to update the height of
the tree in line 34. Otherwise, the testing should be automatic given the list.
