# Binary_Search_Tree

We implement a binary search tree and a simple test driver. All inserts into the binary tree must be unique. 
Implemented methods include insert, find, inorder traverse, and iterator. 

## Usage

python3 test_BST.py

Feel free to change the list of numbers L = [3,4,1,100,-33] to another list. Just make sure to update the height of
the tree in line 34. Otherwise, the testing should be automatic given the list.
